# Algorithms and Data Structures Class Portfolio

## Overview
This contains C# classes that demontrate Algorithms and Data structures.

### [BigONotation.cs](DSA/Algorithms//BigONotation.cs)
- contains the O(1), O(n), and O(n²) methods.

### [shuffle.cs](DSA/Algorithms/shuffle.cs)
- The fisher yates method of shuffling. A an algorithm that gives every item an equal chance of appearing in any postion in the list.

### [Sorting.cs](DSA/Algorithms/Sorting.cs)
Contains three sorting algorithms i coded to understand how they work
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Selection Sort**

### Data Structures
Contains Data structures I built from scratch instead of using .NET’s built-ins. Mostly just practice to understand how things work.

- **CustomArray.cs** - My own resizable array.
- **CustomLinkedList.cs** – A simple linked list using custom Node classes.
- **CustomStack.cs** – Stack (LIFO).
- **CustomQueue.cs** – Queue (FIFO).
- **CustomDictionary.cs** – A small key/value storage system
- **Node.cs / PairedNode.cs**
